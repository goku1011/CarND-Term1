    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the function of extract_hog_features in the Jupyter notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations = 9`, `pixels_per_cell = 8`, and `cells_per_block = 2`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",

    "Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=8` and `cells_per_block=2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried various combinations of parameters and finally I found the combination of orientation=9, pixel_per_cell=8 and cells_per_block=2 return the best result of the shape of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained a linear SVM using the combination of three features which are HOG, spatial bins and color histogram. The dimension of the entire feature vector is 8460 and there are about 10000 images containing vehicle and nonvehicle images are feed into the classifier. The accuracy of the test set which is 20% of the entire images set is 99.3%\n",

    "### Sliding Window Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately I searched on three kinds of window size which are (84,84), (96,96), (128,128) using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector and only do the window search on the ROI(x:(660,1280),y:(400:660))which provided a nice result.  Here is one example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_c.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project I only use three windows to detect the vehicle and the result seems reasonable. But actually the window size is not decrease as I expected, the size of the window increases sometimes. Besides, in the position where the black vehicle overtakes the black vehicle, there appears a third window in a second which is not as expectec either. So to solve the first problem I think adding more windows is ok. And to sovle the second problem needs fine tuning the heatmap."
